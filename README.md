# Z30n's Remote Access Tool

A small mod item for Stalker OP-2.2 or Cumulative Pack 2.2 that allow a player to access/view/search items in player created stashes remotely from any map in the zone using a simple GUI Interface.


## Installation
1. Download the zip file from the Github Repository.
2. Extract the files to your OP-2.2 game directory.
3. After extracting the zip files you should have a gamedata folder and an fsgame.ltx file (If you do not have any mods installed previously) inside your OP-2.2 installed directory.
4. The zip file includes anti-cheat disable so you don't have to worry about the achievements. (If you are going for the S.T.A.L.K.E.R achievement then you should be fine. Good Luck Stalker!)
## File Conflicts
If you have any other previous mods installed in your OP-2.2 game directory, make sure to check which files are over written by this mod.

The files that would most likely have conflicts are:

    1. ui_icon_equipment.dds
    2. binder_safe.script

If you have installed the OP-2.2 English and Russian translation mod by StormTetris:

You do not have to worry about the files being overwritten.

## Basic Guide
Once you have obtained the Remote Access tool, you need to first add your stashes to the Linked Stashes list to open them remotely.

Opening the stashes using the Remote Access Tool requires you to have a Teleport Artefact with enough minimum condition. 

The Teleport Uses in the top right indicates how many times you can open your stash remotely. A single Teleport artifact has around ~10 uses.

Stolen Stashes cannot be opened with the Remote Access Tool and must be retrieved to access the stash remotely.


#### A. Adding and renaming a stash using the Remote Access Tool
1. To add a new or an existing stash open the stash directly and you should see a popup dialog box.

2. Enter the name of your stash into the dialog box. (If you leave it empty the stash name will be set to a default name based on which map the stash is placed.)

If you do not want to add the stash to the Remote Access tool and just want to open the stash then just hit Cancel and you should be able to access the stash normally.

3. Once you have entered the name and clicked OK, you should get a message informing you about the addition of new stash to the Remote Access Tool.

4. You can open your PDA and check the stash map spot and verify the name and the status of the link to your Remote Access Tool.

5. You can now open your Remote Access Tool from your inventory to verify your stash is added to the Linked Stashes list.

You can now view the contents of your stash directly from the Remote Access Tool without using your PDA. Since this is a new stash the stash is indeed empty.

6. To Rename a stash click the Rename button and a dialog box should open with the current name of your selected stash.

7. After Confirming the new name you should see the list updated with the new name of your stash.

8. Your stash map spot will also be updated with the new stash name.

#### B. Preview stash contents using the Remote Access Tool

1. You can view the contents of your Linked Stashes without opening the stash. Viewing stash contents does not consume Teleport artifact uses. Open your Remote Access Tool and select from the list of your Linked Stashes.

2. After selecting the stash from the list a preview window should appear on the right displaying all the contents of your selected stash.

#### C. Searching for an item using Remote Access Tool

1. The Remote Access Tool has an in-built search function which allows you to search for an item in all of your Linked Stashes.

2. Let's say you want to search for a dummy artefact.

3. After clicking OK, you should get a preview window to the left showing you the results of all items matching the word 'dummy'.

![](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/m7m1tufe60srtrw9pq3sw/RAT_search_03.jpg?rlkey=qy977ccnnj9k6k9e6rkqe7mke&st=oeh9i7ov&raw=1)

The Green text are the items from your search result and the yellow number is the total number of said item in all of your linked stashes. The following white text are the names of the stashes in which the item is stored and the quantity of said item.

4. Clicking on the Garbage - Artifacts, Mutant Parts, Misc stash, we see the stash contains two Dummy artefacts.
